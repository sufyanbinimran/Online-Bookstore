# 📚 Online Book Store

A simple and responsive online book store website built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. This project simulates an e-commerce platform where users can explore a collection of books, view details, and interact with features like signup/login, cart management, and more — all in a static frontend environment.
